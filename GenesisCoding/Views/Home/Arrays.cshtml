<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
    An array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, <br />
    but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and <br />
    use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
</p>

<h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>

<p>To declare an array in C#, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<p>datatype[] arrayName;</p>

<p>For example: double[] balance;</p>

<p>Initializing an Array</p>

<p>Declaring an array does not initialize the array in the memory. When the array variable is initialized, you can assign values to the array.</p>

<p>Array is a reference type, so you need to use the <b>new</b> keyword to create an instance of the array. For example,</p>

<p>double[] balance = new double[10];</p>

<h2>Assigning Values to an Array</h2>

<p>You can assign values to individual array elements, by using the index number, like:</p>

<p>
    double[] balance = new double[10]; <br />
    balance[0] = 4500.0;
</p>

<p>You can assign values to the array at the time of declaration, as shown:</p>

<p>double[] balance = { 2340.0, 4523.69, 3421.0};</p>

<p>You can also create and initialize an array, as shown:</p>

<p>int [] marks = new int[5]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};</p>

<p>You can copy an array variable into another target array variable. In such case, both the target and source point to the same memory location:</p>

<p>
    int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95}; <br />
    int[] score = marks;
</p>

<p>
    When you create an array, C# compiler implicitly initializes each array element to a default value depending on the array type. <br />
    For example, for an int array all elements are initialized to 0.
</p>

<h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>

<p>
    An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets <br />
    after the name of the array. For example,
</p>

<p>double salary = balance[9];</p>
